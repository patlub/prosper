            <div><p>Don’t do the expected, do the extraordinary – something we apply to every project we take on.
                Probably because we think life’s too short for ordinary, and we also think life’s too dull in grey.</p>

                <p>So when we arrive at work each morning, we have one thing in mind – to get people talking about your
                    brand. We do this by being more than just your average printing and gifting company. We inspire
                    solutions that go beyond the ordinary. Solutions that not only give your brand extra reach, but a
                    little extra kick too. Just like adding chilli to your favourite pizza.</p>

                <p>Our special magic factory is situated in Kamwokya, and it’s where all our crazy ideas
                    come to life. With a focus on quality production, consistency and speedy delivery, anything is
                    possible – you just have to believe.</p>

                <p>From concept to design to printing, we make sure we provide a tailored, one-of-a-kind service for our
                    clients. And we make sure we make it fun. After all, it takes fewer muscles to smile than it does to
                    frown. At Prospa, it’s never business as usual. It’s business above and beyond.
                    <b>Boldly different. Always inspiring.</b></p>

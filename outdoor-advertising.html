                <p><b>Bulletins</b></p>

                <p>Bulletins are the largest, most impactful standard-size form of outdoor media. Located on highly visible locations, such as expressways and primary arteries, they offer advertisers exposure from heavy traffic patterns. Bulletins afford great visibility due not only to their size, but because they allow creative customizing through extensions and embellishments. </p>
                <p>There are two types of bulletins, permanent and rotary. Rotary bulletins are moved to different, pre-approved locations periodically to give broad market coverage.Permanent bulletins afford dominant coverage of high traffic at fixed locations; advertising remains at a location throughout the contract duration. Bulletins are also used for directional or selected geo-demographic coverage purposes.</p>

                <p><b>Digital Billboards</b></p>
                <p>Utilizing the newest technology, digital billboards are computer controlled LED displays. Their colors are vibrant and the images are crystal-clear.</p>
                <p>Six to eight advertisers rotate continuously, each one having seven to ten seconds to display a static image. Ads can be scheduled to run at certain times of the day or on particular days of the week.
